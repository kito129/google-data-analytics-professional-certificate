## What is ETL? <a name="section-1"></a>

### Extraction
Extraction is the process of retrieving data from one or more sources—online, on-premises, legacy, SaaS, or others. After the retrieval, or extraction, is complete, the data is loaded into a staging area.

### Transformation
Transformation involves taking that data, cleaning it, and putting it into a common format, so it can be stored in a targeted database, data store, data warehouse, or data lake. Cleaning typically involves taking out duplicate, incomplete, or obviously erroneous records.

### Loading
Loading is the process of inserting that formatted data into the target database, data store, data warehouse, or data lake.

##### The six phases of data analysis

- ASK
    Analysts needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result.
- PREPARE
    It all started with solid preparation, the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step.
- PROCESS
    The data analysts also made sure clients understood how their data would be collected, stored, managed, and protected.
    They cleaned the data to make sure it was **complete**, correct, and **relevant**.
- ANALYZE
    Then, the analysts did what they do best: analyze! From the completed surveys, the data analysts discovered that an employee’s experience with certain processes was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction.
- SHARE
    Must as they made sure the data was carefully protected, the analysts were also careful sharing the report.
- ACT
    The last stage of the process for the team of analysts was to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to implement changes and take actions based on the findings.

#### Big data analytics process
Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics process in their book, [Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Fundamentals-Techniques-Technology/dp/0134291077)

- Business case evaluation
- Data identification
- Data acquisition and filtering
- Data extraction
- Data validation and cleaning
- Data aggregation and representation
- Data analysis
- Data visualization
- Utilization of analysis results

**Gut** instinct is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something **conscious**; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right.

ATTENTION: If you ignore data by preferring to make decisions based on your own experience, your decisions may be biased.

In addition, try asking yourself these questions about a project to help find the perfect balance:

- What kind of results are needed?
- Who will be informed?
- Am I answering the question being asked?
- How quickly does a decision need to be made?

> Balancing data and gut instinct is crucial for making informed decisions, and the right mix depends on the project's goals and time constraints.

#### Data-driven decision making

1 - Business need
2 - Data collection
3 - Data processing
4 - Data analysis
5 - Data-driven decision

> The final goal is to share insights data with "Subject matter experts" who have specific domain knowledge to take actions in a specific area.

### Data Analyst Skills

Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts

- curiosity
- understanding context
- having technical mindset
    A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way
- data design
    Data design is how you organize information. As a data analyst, design typically has to do with an actual database.
- data strategy
    Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis


### Analytical thinking

Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.

The five key aspects to analytical thinking: 

- visualization 
    In data analytics, visualization is the graphical representation of information. Some examples include graphs, maps, or other design elements. Visualization is important because visuals can help data analysts understand and explain information more effectively.
- strategy 
    With so much data available, having a strategic mindset is key to staying focused and on track. Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there. Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect.
- problem-orientation 
    Data analysts use a problem- oriented approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems. It's all about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project.
- correlation 
    Being able to identify a correlation between two or more pieces of data. A correlation is like a relationship.
- big-picture and detail-oriented thinking.
    This means being able to see the big picture as well as the details. A jigsaw puzzle is a great way to think about this. Big-picture thinking is like looking at a complete puzzle

If you make decisions that are informed by data, you are more likely to make more informed and effective decisions. 
It's much more likely to be successful if everyone is on board and on the same page, so it's important to make sure specific procedures are in place and that your technology being used is aligned with your data-driven strategy

> First, think about curiosity and context. The more you learn about the power of data, the more curious you're likely to become.

> **Correlation != Causation**

#### Make questions

What is the **root cause of a problem**? A root cause is the reason why a problem occurs. If we can identify and get rid of a root cause, we can prevent that problem from happening again. 

A simple way to wrap your head around root causes is with the process called the **Five Whys**. In the Five Whys you ask "why" five times to reveal the root cause.

Another question commonly asked by data analysts is, where are the gaps in our process? For this, many people will use something **called gap analysis**. 

The general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now compared to where you want to be. Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them.

A third question that data analysts ask a lot is, **what did we not consider before?** This is a great way to think about what information or procedure might be missing from a process, so you can identify ways to make better decisions and strategies moving forward. 

#### [Five Whys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q89tdSjE-0)

One very common question is, “What is the **root cause of the problem**?” A root cause is the reason why a problem occurs. So, by identifying and eliminating the root cause, data professionals can help stop that problem from occurring again. 

The five whys is a simple but effective technique for identifying a root cause. It involves asking "Why?" repeatedly until the answer reveals itself. This often happens at the fifth “why,” but sometimes you’ll need to continue asking more times, sometimes fewer.


### Assessment-taking strategies
As you progress through this program, you will complete graded assessments at the end of each module. Assessments are a useful signpost for you to note your progress or identify concepts or skills you need to review. However, assessments can sometimes feel overwhelming. Approaching them with a strategy can make them more manageable. To help you do just that, this reading will give you a list of tips and strategies you can use to set yourself up for success and feel confident in your ability to overcome these challenges.

Before taking an assessment: 
Review your notes, the videos, the readings, and the most recent glossary to refresh yourself on the content. 

Find a picture of something or an object that makes you feel happy. For example, you might look at a photograph of a beautiful beach or a peaceful forest when you feel overwhelmed. 

During the assessment:
Review the test before filling in answers. Remember to check your work before you click Submit. 

Answer the easy questions first; skip the ones you don’t know the answer to right away.

For multiple choice questions, focus on eliminating the wrong answers first. 

Read each question twice. There are often clues that are easy to miss the first time.

Remember to slow down and trust your knowledge. You probably know more than you give yourself credit for.

Take some time during the assessment to rest for a few seconds. This can really help calm your nerves.

If you start to feel anxious:
Spell your name backwards or do an easy math problem. This brings you back to the frontal lobe of your brain, which helps you recall information more easily. 

Focus on calm, steady breathing. 

Visualize success.

Before you submit the assessment:
Check your work, but be confident. Sometimes people change correct answers because they feel wrong, but they’re actually right. Your first instinct is usually correct. 

After you submit the assessment:
Take a deep breath and give yourself some positive feedback. Regardless of your score, your effort was a worthwhile learning experience! 

Remember, you can retake the assessment if you aren’t satisfied with your score. 


## Module 2 - Follow the data cycle

### The life cycle of data is 

The life cycle of data is 
- **Plan**: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.
- **Capture**: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.
- **Manage**: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.
- **Analyze**: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.
- **Archive**: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
- **Destroy**: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

#### Plan
During this stage, all elements of the Model should be evaluated, addressed, and documented
#### Capture
represents the activities through which new or existing data are collected, generated, or considered and evaluated for re-use. . Scientists
are skillful in designing data acquisition techniques to address
research questions; in the USGS context, this element emphasizes the importance of considering relevant USGS policies
and best practices that maintain the provenance and integrity
of the data as a USGS information product.
#### Manage
represents various activities associated with preparation of new or previously collected data inputs. 
Processing of input data may entail definition of data elements; integration of disparate datasets; extraction, transformation, and load operations
for integration and analysis
#### Analyze
Represents the activities associated with the exploration and interpretation of processed data, where hypotheses are tested, discoveries
are made, and conclusions are drawn. Analytical activities include summarization, graphing, statistical analysis, spatial
analysis, and modeling, and are used to produce scientific results and information. In this element new data are generated, versions are tracked, and processes are documented: **metadata**. 
#### Archive
Represents the activities associated with storing data for long-term use and accessibility. Preservation often is not considered until the end
stage of a project, when it might be neglected because of the pressure of project budgets and timetables. The intentional
placement of this element ahead of Publish/Share in the Model is a reminder that federally funded scientists must plan for the
long-term preservation of data, metadata, ancillary products, application-neutral storage formats, and any additional documentation, to ensure availability and re-use.
#### Destroy

### The phases of data analysis and this program

#### Ask
We define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations. Stakeholders hold a stake in the project. They are people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.
First, defining a problem means you look at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state. Usually there's an obstacle we need to get rid of or something wrong that needs to be fixed. For instance, a sports arena might want to reduce the time fans spend waiting in the ticket line. The obstacle is figuring out how to get the customers to their seats more quickly. Another important part of the ask phase is understanding stakeholder expectations. The first step here is to determine who the stakeholders are. 
But what they all have in common is that they help make decisions, influence actions and strategies, and have specific goals they want to meet.
